## Regularization
### Ridge and Lasso
Ridge and Lasso regression are techniques used to solve overfitting in linear regression models. They achieve this by adding a penalty term to the regression equation, which shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero, thus reducing model complexity and improving its ability to generalize to new data.
