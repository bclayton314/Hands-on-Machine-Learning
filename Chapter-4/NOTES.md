# Training Models

### Linear Regression
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine-learning algorithm that learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points with most optimized linear functions which can be used for prediction on new datasets. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the input and output, meaning the output changes at a constant rate as the input changes. This relationship is represented by a straight line.  
y = mx + b

### The Normal Equation


## Regularization
### Ridge and Lasso
Ridge and Lasso regression are techniques used to solve overfitting in linear regression models. They achieve this by adding a penalty term to the regression equation, which shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero, thus reducing model complexity and improving its ability to generalize to new data.
