# Hands-on-Machine-Learning

  This repo is for studying from / doing exercises with the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron". It's my hope to get a comprehensive, foundational understanding of Machine Learning and to use this repo as a test example for future AI / ML books and endeavors. My ultimate goal is to become as proficient as possible in the field of AI / ML with an initial focus on Machine Learning and moving onto Deep Learning.
