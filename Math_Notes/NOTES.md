## Matrix Calculus for Deep Learning  
-vector calculus and partial derivatives  
-Generalization of the Jacobian  
-Derivatives of vector element-wise binary operators  
-Derivatives involving scalar expansion  


## CALCULUS
-Derivatives  
  -calculates rates of change, slope of a single point  

-Integrals  
  -calculates areas under curves, accumulation of a quantity  

-Limits  
  -useful for calculations involving indeterminate values i.e. infinity, single points on curves, slopes with only a point, areas of curves
